# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This machine learning project classifies Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
based on sepal and petal measurements using multiple classification models.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `iris.py`: Main script that loads the dataset, visualizes it, prepares the data, trains models, and evaluates results.
- `Iris.csv`: Dataset (from UCI Machine Learning Repository).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python iris.py
   ```

## ðŸ¤– Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## ðŸ“Š Outputs

- Accuracy and cross-validation scores
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Model comparison bar chart
- Predictions on new flower measurements

## ðŸ“š Concepts Demonstrated

- Classification
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Train-test splitting
- Cross-validation
- Model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
- Making predictions on new data
